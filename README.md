# MERN Stack Code Analysis with GitHub Actions

This GitHub project provides automated analysis of a fullstack project built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) using a variety of powerful tools, including GitHub Actions workflows, CYCLONEDx, SonarCloud, dependency tracker, and python detect-secrets.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to identify potential security risks, performance bottlenecks, code quality issues, and dependencies in MERN stack projects. By analyzing the code early in the development process, the team can address any issues before they become major problems.

## Tools

The following tools are used to automate the analysis process:

- **GitHub Actions workflows**: Automates the entire analysis process and runs on every pull request, commit, and push to the repository.

- **CYCLONEDx**: Analyzes dependencies and identifies known vulnerabilities or security issues.

- **SonarCloud**: Performs a comprehensive code analysis and generates a report that highlights any potential issues.

- **Dependency tracker**: Analyzes dependencies and tracks any changes made to them.

- **Python detect-secrets**: Scans the codebase for potential secrets or sensitive information that may have been accidentally committed to the repository.

## Usage

To use this project, simply include the appropriate tools and workflows in your MERN stack project. The analysis will run automatically on every pull request, commit, and push to the repository.

## Conclusion

By using this project to analyze MERN stack projects, the team can identify and address potential issues early in the development process, reducing the risk of major problems down the line.
